# Offensive Security Portfolio

Technical write-ups and security research focused on Network Penetration Testing and Web Application Security.

# About Me

I am a Computer Science student at the Open University of Israel and an aspiring Security Researcher. My expertise spans across:

Network Security: Specialized in exploiting remote systems via network services and ports, infrastructure assessment, and system compromise.

Web Security: Deep-diving into web vulnerabilities, WAF bypasses, and logic flaws.

Currently, I am bridging the gap between low-level system exploitation and modern web-based attack vectors.
